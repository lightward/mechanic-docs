Hey there! :) I'm Isaac, the creator of Mechanic.

AI makes it easy to create code that's hard to fix.

As of this writing (currently May 4, 2025), AI is getting better at Mechanic, but is still pretty uneven in its results. AI code frequently "invents" Mechanic features that do not exist (like writing task code in YAML), or fails to invoke necessary Mechanic features (like [subscriptions](core/tasks/subscriptions.md), frequently).

For now, if you're having issues with an AI-written task, your absolute best bet is to talk with a professional from the Mechanic partners list at [partners.mechanic.dev](https://partners.mechanic.dev/). Your task may need to be retooled, and possibly fully rewritten from scratch, by someone who can dynamically account for the practical realities of Mechanic and Shopify. As of right now, this seems to generally mean a human.

We-the-platform-team are available for issues with the platform itself, but we can't get hands-on with custom code â€” whether written by a human or an AI or anything else. For a general overview of custom code on Mechanic, see [learn.mechanic.dev/custom](custom.md).
