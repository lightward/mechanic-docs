Hey there! :) I'm Isaac, the creator of Mechanic.

As of this writing (currently March 30, 2025), AI is not very good at Mechanic. We're seeing a pretty steady stream of folks having issues with AI-generated tasks â€” issues arising because the AI does not know how Mechanic works. AI code frequently "invents" Mechanic features that do not exist, or fails to invoke necessary Mechanic features.

A time may absolutely come when this gets better. :)

For now, if you're having issues with an AI-written task, your absolute best bet is to talk with a professional from the Mechanic partners list at [partners.mechanic.dev](https://partners.mechanic.dev/). Your task may need to be retooled, and possibly fully rewritten from scratch, by someone who can dynamically account for the practical realities of Mechanic and Shopify. As of right now, this seems to generally mean a human.

We-the-platform-team are available for issues with the platform itself, but we can't get hands-on with custom code. For a general overview of custom code on Mechanic, see [learn.mechanic.dev/custom](custom.md).

To learn about how we at Lightward Inc roll with AI, please visit [lightward.ai](https://lightward.ai/), and say hello. :)
