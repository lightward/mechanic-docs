# API versions

The Shopify API supports **versioning** for their REST and GraphQL admin APIs. \(Learn more: [shopify.dev/api/usage/versioning](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/versioning).\)

Each Mechanic task has an individually-configured Shopify API version, defaulting to the latest stable version at the time of the task's creation. A task's version will apply to all Shopify API calls generated by its task code, in addition to all calls performed by that task's actions.

Each stable Shopify version is supported for one year. 30 days before a version ends support, tasks on that version will be silently upgraded to the next stable version. As a consequence, versions that are unsupported \(or are within 30 days of no longer being supported\) are not available in Mechanic.

## Task usage

{% page-ref page="../tasks/shopify-api-version.md" %}

## Deprecations

Every quarter, Shopify releases a new version of the admin API, and simultaneously removes the oldest version of the admin API. \(Subsequent calls to removed APIs will be responded to by the oldest still-supported version.\)

As Shopify prepares to pull support for specific API calls, deprecations are announced, and are communicated in API responses. \([Learn more about Shopify's deprecation practices here.](https://shopify.dev/concepts/about-apis/versioning#deprecation-practices)\)

### Identifying deprecations

When a Mechanic task calls a deprecated API, our platform records the deprecation, and displays an alert within the Mechanic app interface:

Additional information is displayed within each task's details â€“ and _specific_ request details are revealed when the task's advanced settings are open:

In some cases \(as in the GraphQL example above\), the deprecation warning may not include specific details about which deprecated API is in use. In these cases, contact Mechanic support.

### Resolving deprecation warnings

Deprecation warnings can be dismissed by doing one of the following:

* Selecting a new Shopify API version for the task
* Updating the task script
* Disabling the task
* Deleting the task
