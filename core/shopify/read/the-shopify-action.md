# The Shopify action

The [**Shopify action**](../../actions/integrations/shopify.md) allows developers to submit any request to the Shopify Admin API. By [**responding to action results**](../../../techniques/responding-to-action-results.md), the data returned by Shopify can be retrieved, and re-used by the calling task.

This approach should (probably) only be used as a last resort, when Mechanic's other methods of [**reading data**](./) do not cover the scenario.
