# Import and export

Mechanic tasks may be imported and exported as JSON, using the "Import" or "Export" button below the task editor. The JSON schema used for representing tasks is identical to that used by the **task library**, making it suitable for [contributing to the task library](../../resources/task-library/contributing.md).

## Importing

Mechanic has the ability to import tasks from JSON individually and in bulk, from the "Import tasks" screen.

Each task loaded via this route may be saved as a new task, or – if the task name exactly matches the name of a task already in the Mechanic account – it may be saved _over_ the existing task. This latter path provides a way for batches of updated tasks to be loaded into a Mechanic account all together, preserving the version history for each task.

To import one or more tasks from a JSON export, use the "Import tasks" button on the Mechanic home screen.

On the next screen, follow the prompts to load your JSON task exports into Mechanic.

### Importing in the task editor

When working in the task editor for a specific task, use the "Import" button to load in task JSON and have it applied to the current task.

## Exporting

When viewing the task list on the Mechanic home screen, use the "Export" button after selecting one or more tasks to copy a JSON export of all tasks to the clipboard. This export can be used with Mechanic's task import area, described above.
