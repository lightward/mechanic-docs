# Actions

In Mechanic, an **action** is an instruction for performing work that has an effect. Actions are generated by [**tasks**](../tasks/), in response to [**events**](../events/). Each action has a **type**, specifying the class of operation to be performed, and **options**, providing specifics about what that operation will do.

Actions are defined by tasks using [**action objects**](../tasks/code/action-objects.md), which are simple JSON objects specifying an action's type and options. Action objects can be constructed using the [**action tag**](../../platform/liquid/tags/action.md).

## Action types

An **action type** determines the class of operation to be performed. While actions may vary greatly, there are only a few action types:

| Action | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Cache](cache.md) | Performing operations on the store's Mechanic cache |
| [Echo](echo.md) | Debugging; displays the options that it is provided, with no side-effects |
| [Email](email.md) | Sending transactional email |
| [Event](event.md) | Generating custom user events |
| [Files](files.md) | Generating files of various types, storing them at a temporary Mechanic-provided URL |
| [FTP](ftp.md) | Performing FTP file uploads and downloads |
| [HTTP](http.md) | Performing HTTP requests |
| [Shopify](shopify.md) | Sending requests to the Shopify Admin API, supporting both REST and GraphQL |
