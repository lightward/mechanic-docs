# Actions

In Mechanic, an **action** is an instruction for performing work that has an effect. Actions are generated by [**tasks**](../tasks/), in response to [**events**](../events/). Each action has a **type**, specifying the class of operation to be performed, and **options**, providing specifics about what that operation will do.

Actions are defined by tasks using [**action objects**](../tasks/code/action-objects.md), which are simple JSON objects specifying an action's type and options. Action objects can be constructed using the [**action tag**](../../platform/liquid/tags/action.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
In Mechanic, actions are performed after their originating task run concludes. Actions are not performed inline during the task's Liquid rendering.

To inspect and respond to the results of an HTTP action, add a task subscription to mechanic/actions/perform, allowing the action to re-invoke the task with the action result data.

## Action types

An **action type** determines the class of operation to be performed. While actions may vary greatly, there are only a few action types.
