# Locksmith

### What is [Locksmith](https://apps.shopify.com/locksmith?utm\_source=mechanic\&utm\_medium=learn-mechanic-dev)?

As a tool, Locksmith's power comes from a super-versatile yet super-simple idea: locks to protect your content, and keys to let different people in. Locksmith is made by Lightward (us) the same makers as Mechanic. Give [Locksmith](https://apps.shopify.com/locksmith?utm\_source=mechanic\&utm\_medium=learn-mechanic-dev) a try today!

Once you've locked something, use keys to grant access if the customerâ€¦

* has a certain tag
* is signed in
* gives a certain passcode
* arrives via a secret link
* is not signed in
* does not have a certain tag
* gives one of many passcodes
* subscribes to your Mailchimp list or newsletter
* subscribes to your Klaviyo list or newsletter
* has one of many email addresses
* the customer's email contains something specific
* has purchased a specific product
* has placed at least x orders
* has a certain product in their cart
* has a certain variant in their cart
* has at least $x in their cart
* has a certain IP address
* is visiting from a certain country
* is visiting before a certain date and time
* is visiting after a certain date and time

Or, grant access using any custom condition by using a little Liquid code.

### Locksmith --> Mechanic Integration

Every time access is granted to a resource on a store using [Locksmith](https://apps.shopify.com/locksmith?utm\_source=mechanic\&utm\_medium=learn-mechanic-dev), an event is sent to Mechanic with the following payload for the `locksmith/sessions/ping` event topic
