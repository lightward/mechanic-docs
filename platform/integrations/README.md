# Integrations

Mechanic maintains several official integration points:

* [Judge.me](judge.me.md)
* [Locksmith](locksmith.md)
* [Report Toaster](report-toaster.md)
* [Shopify Flow](shopify-flow.md)

Mechanic can be used with most HTTP APIs, via the [HTTP action](../../core/actions/http.md) (for sending and receiving data) and its [webhook system](../webhooks.md) (for receiving pushed data). This makes it possible for developers to manually integrate many more services.

If you need a hand exploring a custom integration, start here: ["I need something custom!"](../../custom.md).
