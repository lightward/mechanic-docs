# Integrations

### Need a service that's not on this list?

Mechanic can be used with most HTTP APIs, via the [HTTP action](../../core/actions/http.md) (for sending and receiving data) and its [webhook system](../webhooks.md) (for receiving pushed data). This makes it possible for developers to manually integrate many more third-party services, as long as the service in question has an appropriate API.

The [Mechanic task library](https://tasks.mechanic.dev/) has a limited selection of tasks integrating with third-party services.

If you don't find a match in the task library, consider [a custom task](../../custom.md) to achieve your integration.
