### Need a service that's not on this list?

Mechanic can be used with most HTTP APIs, via the [HTTP action](../../core/actions/http.md) (for sending and receiving data) and its [webhook system](../webhooks.md) (for receiving pushed data). This makes it possible for developers to manually integrate many more third-party services, as long as the service in question has an appropriate API.

The [Mechanic task library](https://tasks.mechanic.dev/) has a limited selection of tasks integrating with third-party services.

If you don't find a match in the task library, consider a custom task to achieve your integration. Start here: ["I need something custom!](../../custom.md)

### oAuth

Mechanic supports OAuth 2.0, enhancing its integration capabilities with popular services like Airtable, Google Drive, and Slack. This feature enables streamlined authentication processes, allowing users to seamlessly connect and authorize these services within Mechanic.

Need a service not on the list, put in a feature request [here](https://mechanic.canny.io/futures).
