# Pricing

Our top priority is to create health for ourselves, and to give you the best tools we can for creating health for you. (We interpret "health" broadly: healthy transactions created in healthy business can enable health in a million other areas.)

We believe (a) that the financial side of this is as important to get right as the technical side, and (b) that the best way to guarantee healthy financial movement is through clear and invitingly open conversation.

**In practice, here's what that means:**

1. When you install our app, we suggest a subscription price for you based on the cost of your Shopify plan, based on the prices that Shopify publishes. In general, we'll suggest a third of the Shopify plan cost.
2. If you want to keep using our app, and the price feels good to you, you pay it ‚Äì no further conversation needed.
3. If the price we suggest doesn't feel good, you tell us what price _does_ feel good to you, by emailing [team@usemechanic.com](mailto:team@usemechanic.com). This is important: the price we suggested was based on what we were able to see about you, but we're not claiming to know your entire story. In this part of the conversation, we rely on you to improve our knowledge of what's right for you, by asking you _specifically_ what price you'll feel good paying.
4. Our turn! If we can meet you at that number, we will. We'll update your account with the price you talked about, and we'll all move forward from there. (If we can't, then we'll talk about that too ‚Äì it'll be our turn to execute step 3.)

A note about ‚Äúwhat feels good‚Äù: when talking about numbers, it‚Äôs that sweet spot where you feel you‚Äôre appropriately investing in something. Only you know what that number is for you, where you‚Äôre neither straining yourself to afford the thing, nor paying a number that represents undervaluing what you receive. If that gives you pause, it‚Äôs okay. Take a minute and feel it out. :)

### "Why are there price tiers shown on the App Store?"

Shopify doesn't _specifically_ support pricing models like ours. So we compromise by showing the suggested pricing for each Shopify plan, with a note immediately below referencing the actual policy in play.

It's a bit of a risky move, because this _sort of_ makes it look like we have pricing plans that one could switch between. To be clear: [we do not have pricing plans](plans.md). These figures reflect the suggested prices auto-generated for each Shopify plan, and they _are_ only suggestions.

Per step #2 of the policy, if a suggested price works for you, you're free to accept it immediately and proceed. Per the _rest_ of the policy, if that price _doesn't_ feel good to you, write in to [team@usemechanic.com](mailto:team@usemechanic.com), and we'll work together to find one that feels good to everyone. :)
