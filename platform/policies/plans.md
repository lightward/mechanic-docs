# Plans

**Mechanic does not have different plans.** The following details apply to every Mechanic account:

* Each account in good standing may install an unlimited number of [tasks](../../core/tasks/), may receive an unlimited number of [events](../../core/events/), and may process an unlimited number of [runs](../../core/runs/).
* Each account has a limited-term trial period, during which no billing agreement is required.
  * When the trial period expires, Mechanic will suspend the account, and will stop processing incoming events for that account.
  * Shopify stores that will only be used for development and testing, which will never see production customer traffic, are invited to write to [team@usemechanic.com](mailto:team@usemechanic.com) to request a super-extended trial period.
* Every account qualifies for our [pay-what-feels-good pricing policy](pricing.md), in which our system offers a suggested price based on Shopify plan type, inviting the user to contact [team@usemechanic.com](mailto:team@usemechanic.com) to talk about what price feels good to them.
  * Mechanic exclusively uses monthly billing.
* Every account is subject to our [data policy](data.md).

## Development stores

Mechanic is Partner-friendly! If you have a Mechanic account used exclusively for development or testing, receiving no customer traffic, send the core team an email at [team@usemechanic.com](mailto:team@usemechanic.com). We can usually help out by granting a super-extended trial period. :\)
