# Metafield collection object

{% hint style="info" %}
This page is part of a series: see [Metafields](./) for an overview on how Mechanic's Liquid implementation thinks about metafields.
{% endhint %}

A metafield collection object is an iterable set of metafields, which also supports using lookups to narrow the set by metafield namespace, or, further, to identify a single metafield by looking up by key.

## How to access it

* Use `resource.metafields` to retrieve the full set of that resource's metafields
* Use `resource.metafields.namespace` to retrieve the full set of that resource's metafields, filtering by metafield namespace
* Use `resource.metafields.namespace.key` to retrieve a [metafield representation object](metafield-representation-object.md) â€“ _unless_ the referenced metafield has a [deprecated type](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/objects/metafield#deprecated-metafields), in which case the parsed metafield value is returned directly
