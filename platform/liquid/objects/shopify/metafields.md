# Metafields object

This object allows you to iterate through a resource's metafields, or to access a single metafield directly by performing lookups using a namespace and then a key.

## How to access it

* To retrieve a list of metafields, use `{% for metafield in resource.metafields %}`, for any resource that supports metafields
* To retrieve a list of metafields having a specific namespace, use `{% for metafield in resource.metafields.namespace %}`, for any resource that supports metafields
* To retrieve a specific metafield value, use `resource.metafields.namespace.key`, for any resource that supports metafields \(see notes below about values in this usage\)

## What it contains

* [Every property from the Metafield resource in the Shopify REST Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/metafield)
* Metafield values retrieved via `resource.metafields.namespace.key` are automatically parsed and typed according to their `"value_type"`. This is the only time that this happens â€“ in every other usage, metafield values are returned exactly as they are found in the Shopify API.
