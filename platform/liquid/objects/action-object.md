# Action object

The Action object describes an [**action**](../../../core-concepts/actions/) that was defined, and the [**run**](../../../core-concepts/runs/) that was performed for that action.

As such, the Action object only comes into play with tasks that subscribe to mechanic/actions/perform, analyzing the results of action runs, for the purpose of performing follow-up work. Learn more about this technique: [Responding to action results](../../../techniques/responding-to-action-results.md).

## How to access it

* Use `{{ action }}` in tasks responding to mechanic/actions/perform

## What it contains

* `type` – a lowercase string, defining the [action type](../../../core-concepts/actions/action-types/)
* `options` – the options with which the action was configured
* `run` – an object containing the following attributes, describing the run that was generated by the action's performance
  * `id` – a string containing the UUID for this action
  * `ok` – a boolean, true for a successful action run, and false for a failure
  * `error` – either null, or a string containing the error message returned for a failed action
  * `result` – the data returned from the action; format varies by action type
  * `result_meta` – an object containing useful performance-related data
  * `attempts` – an integer, indicating the number of times the action was attempted before final success or failure
  * `enqueued_at` – the time at which this action was sent to our queue for execution
  * `started_at` – the time at which the action started
  * `stopped_at` – the time at which the action stopped
  * `elapsed_time_ms` – the number of milliseconds this action required, from start to stop
