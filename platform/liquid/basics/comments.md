# Comments

Comments are an essential part of documenting your task code. In Liquid, comments are created with the `comment` tag.

```javascript
{% raw %}
{% comment %} This is a comment in Liquid {% endcomment %}
{% endraw %}
```

```javascript
{% raw %}
{% comment %} 
  This is a comment in Liquid 
{% endcomment %}
{% endraw %}
```
