# Event topics

Mechanic supports a variety of [**event topics**](../../core/events/topics.md), each a classification of an [**event**](../../core/events/). Each [**task**](../../core/tasks/) can signal its interest in specific topics by using [**subscriptions**](../../core/tasks/subscriptions.md).

This page is a complete index of pre-defined topics, organized by the event topic's **domain**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Incoming events may be selectively filtered out using [event filters](filters.md).
{% endhint %}

## Mechanic

### Actions

* **mechanic/actions/perform**\
  Occurs when an action has been performed, regardless of its success or failure. A task may subscribe to this topic to be notified when each of its actions have been performed, so that the task may then respond to the results.

### Emails

* **mechanic/emails/received**\
  Occurs when Mechanic receives an email sent to the store's dedicated email address. (A store at example.myshopify.com can receive email at example@mail.usemechanic.com.)

### Errors

{% hint style="info" %}
Learn more about [error handling](../error-handling.md).
{% endhint %}

*   **mechanic/errors/action**

    Occurs when an action fails.
* **mechanic/errors/event**\
  Occurs when an event run fails.
* **mechanic/errors/task**\
  Occurs when a task run fails.

### Scheduler

* **mechanic/scheduler/10min**\
  Runs every 10 minutes.
* **mechanic/scheduler/15min**\
  Runs every 15 minutes.
* **mechanic/scheduler/20min**\
  Runs every 20 minutes. (You see where this is going.)
* **mechanic/scheduler/30min**\
  Runs every 30 minutes.
* **mechanic/scheduler/hourly**\
  Runs every hour, on the hour.
* **mechanic/scheduler/daily**\
  Runs at midnight, in the store's local timezone.
* **mechanic/scheduler/monday**\
  Runs every Monday at midnight, in the store's local timezone. (Note: this would be at the end of Sunday evening). Each named weekday is supported.
* **mechanic/scheduler/monthly**\
  Runs at midnight on the 1st of the month, in the store's local timezone.

{% hint style="info" %}
More specific times can be achieved by subscribing to an event topic with a delay (e.g. "mechanic/scheduler/daily+5.hours"). There is no limit to the length of the delay, including delaying longer than the scheduler interval itself (e.g. "mechanic/scheduler/daily+100.hours"). To learn more, see [Subscriptions](../../core/tasks/subscriptions.md).
{% endhint %}

### User

Not to be confused with events in the User domain, the mechanic/user event subject describes ways that the user expresses their intent – to Mechanic – to run the task. [Run links](../integrations/run-links.md) are available for these topics.

* **mechanic/user/trigger**\
  When used, adds a "Run task" button to the task itself. This button generates a new event, to which only this task will respond.
* **mechanic/user/text**\
  When used, adds a "Run task" button to the task itself. This button prompts the user with a multi-line text box. When submitted, an event is generated, to which only this task will respond. The event contains the user's input in its data, making user's input available in `event.data`.
* **mechanic/user/form**\
  When used, adds a "Run task" button to the task itself. When Run Task button is clicked they are presented with form that contains any [task options](../../core/tasks/options/) that have the `_userform` flag. When submitted, an event is generated, to which only this task will respond. The event contains the user's input in its data, making user's input available in `event.data`.

The following mechanic/user topics are typically used with [Shopify admin action links](../../core/shopify/admin-action-links.md), and are documented there more fully.

* **mechanic/user/collection**\
  Occurs when a user sends a collection to Mechanic&#x20;
* **mechanic/user/customer**\
  **mechanic/user/customers**\
  Occurs when a user sends one or more customers to Mechanic&#x20;
* **mechanic/user/draft\_order**\
  **mechanic/user/draft\_orders**\
  Occurs when a user sends one or more draft orders to Mechanic
* **mechanic/user/order**\
  **mechanic/user/orders**\
  Occurs when a user sends one or more orders to Mechanic
* **mechanic/user/variant**\
  **mechanic/user/variants**\
  Occurs when a user sends one or more product variants to Mechanic&#x20;
* **mechanic/user/product**\
  **mechanic/user/products**\
  Occurs when a user sends one or more products to Mechanic&#x20;

## Shopify

These events are generated by Shopify webhooks, and are automatically configured for you by Mechanic. Tasks subscribing to Shopify events receive [Liquid environment variables](../../core/tasks/code/environment-variables.md), containing data from the webhook.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Mechanic does not support Shopify event topics that are scoped to an individual app. For example, Shopify only sends product\_listings/add events to the app responsible for the relevant sales channel, and only sends subscription\_contracts/create events to the app responsible for the relevant customer subscriptions. This scoping renders topics like these irrelevant for apps like Mechanic.

## User

The User event domain is for custom, user-generated events, having any subject and verb (e.g. "user/foo/bar"). As with all events, a User event topic must use the standard three-part topic form, but only the "user/" prefix is mandatory.

Mechanic allows developers several ways to generate custom User events:

* The [Event action](../../core/actions/event.md) can be used with any User event topic
* [Webhooks](../webhooks.md) may be configured to generate events using any User event topic
