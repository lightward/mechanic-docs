# Event topics

Mechanic supports a variety of [**event topics**](../../core/events/topics.md), each a classification of an [**event**](../../core/events/). Each [**task**](../../core/tasks/) can signal its interest in specific topics by using [**subscriptions**](../../core/tasks/subscriptions.md).

This page is a complete index of pre-defined topics, organized by the event topic's **domain**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Incoming events may be selectively filtered out using [event filters](filters.md).
{% endhint %}

## Mechanic

### Actions

* **mechanic/actions/perform**\
  Occurs when an action has been performed, regardless of its success or failure. A task may subscribe to this topic to be notified when each of its actions have been performed, so that the task may then respond to the results. To skip emitting this follow-up for a specific action, set `__perform_event: false` on that action.

### Emails

* **mechanic/emails/received**\
  Occurs when Mechanic receives an email sent to the store's dedicated email address. (A store at example.myshopify.com can receive email at example@mail.usemechanic.com.)

### Errors

{% hint style="info" %}
Learn more about [error handling](../error-handling.md).
{% endhint %}

*   **mechanic/errors/action**

    Occurs when an action fails.
* **mechanic/errors/event**\
  Occurs when an event run fails.
* **mechanic/errors/task**\
  Occurs when a task run fails.

### Scheduler

* **mechanic/scheduler/10min**\
  Runs every 10 minutes.
* **mechanic/scheduler/15min**\
  Runs every 15 minutes.
* **mechanic/scheduler/20min**\
  Runs every 20 minutes. (You see where this is going.)
* **mechanic/scheduler/30min**\
  Runs every 30 minutes.
* **mechanic/scheduler/hourly**\
  Runs every hour, on the hour.
* **mechanic/scheduler/daily**\
  Runs at midnight, in the store's local timezone.
* **mechanic/scheduler/monday**\
  Runs every Monday at midnight, in the store's local timezone. (Note: this would be at the end of Sunday evening). Each named weekday is supported.
* **mechanic/scheduler/monthly**\
  Runs at midnight on the 1st of the month, in the store's local timezone.

{% hint style="info" %}
More specific times can be achieved by subscribing to an event topic with a delay (e.g. "mechanic/scheduler/daily+5.hours"). There is no limit to the length of the delay, including delaying longer than the scheduler interval itself (e.g. "mechanic/scheduler/daily+100.hours"). To learn more, see [Subscriptions](../../core/tasks/subscriptions.md).
{% endhint %}

### User

Not to be confused with events in the User domain, the mechanic/user event subject describes ways that the user expresses their intent – to Mechanic – to run the task. [Run links](../integrations/run-links.md) are available for these topics.

* **mechanic/user/trigger**\
  When used, adds a "Run task" button to the task itself. This button generates a new event, to which only this task will respond.
* **mechanic/user/text**\
  When used, adds a "Run task" button to the task itself. This button prompts the user with a multi-line text box. When submitted, an event is generated, to which only this task will respond. The event contains the user's input in its data, making user's input available in `event.data`.
* **mechanic/user/form**\
  When used, adds a "Run task" button to the task itself. When Run Task button is clicked they are presented with form that contains any [task options](../../core/tasks/options/) that have the `_userform` flag. When submitted, an event is generated, to which only this task will respond. The user's input is available in Liquid as `input.<name>`.

The following mechanic/user topics are typically used with [Shopify admin action links](../../core/shopify/admin-action-links.md), and are documented there more fully.

* **mechanic/user/collection**\
  Occurs when a user sends a collection to Mechanic
* **mechanic/user/customer**\
  **mechanic/user/customers**\
  Occurs when a user sends one or more customers to Mechanic
* **mechanic/user/draft\_order**\
  **mechanic/user/draft\_orders**\
  Occurs when a user sends one or more draft orders to Mechanic
* **mechanic/user/order**\
  **mechanic/user/orders**\
  Occurs when a user sends one or more orders to Mechanic
* **mechanic/user/variant**\
  **mechanic/user/variants**\
  Occurs when a user sends one or more product variants to Mechanic
* **mechanic/user/product**\
  **mechanic/user/products**\
  Occurs when a user sends one or more products to Mechanic

## Shopify

These events are generated by Shopify webhooks, and are automatically configured for you by Mechanic. Tasks subscribing to Shopify events receive [Liquid environment variables](../../core/tasks/code/environment-variables.md), containing data from the webhook.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Mechanic does not support Shopify event topics that are scoped to an individual app. For example, Shopify only sends product\_listings/add events to the app responsible for the relevant sales channel, and only sends subscription\_contracts/create events to the app responsible for the relevant customer subscriptions. This scoping renders topics like these irrelevant for apps like Mechanic.

## User

The User event domain is for custom, user-generated events, having any subject and verb (e.g. "user/foo/bar"). As with all events, a User event topic must use the standard three-part topic form, but only the "user/" prefix is mandatory.

Mechanic allows developers several ways to generate custom User events:

* The [Event action](../../core/actions/event.md) can be used with any User event topic
* [Webhooks](../webhooks.md) may be configured to generate events using any User event topic
