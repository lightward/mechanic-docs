# Event topics

Mechanic supports a variety of [**event topics**](../../core/events/topics.md), each a classification of an [**event**](../../core/events/). This page is a complete index of pre-defined topics, organized by **domain** and **subject**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Incoming events may be selectively filtered out using [event filters](filters.md).
{% endhint %}

## Mechanic

### Actions

* **mechanic/actions/perform**\
  ****Occurs when an action has been performed, regardless of its success or failure. A task may subscribe to this topic to be notified when each of its actions have been performed, so that the task may then respond to the results.

### Emails

* **mechanic/emails/received**\
  ****Occurs when Mechanic receives an email sent to the store's dedicated email address. (A store at example.myshopify.com can receive email at example@mail.usemechanic.com.)

### Scheduler

* **mechanic/scheduler/10min**\
  ****Runs every 10 minutes.
* **mechanic/scheduler/15min**\
  ****Runs every 15 minutes.
* **mechanic/scheduler/20min**\
  ****Runs every 20 minutes. (You see where this is going.)
* **mechanic/scheduler/30min**\
  ****Runs every 30 minutes.
* **mechanic/scheduler/hourly**\
  ****Runs every hour, on the hour.
* **mechanic/scheduler/daily**\
  ****Runs at midnight, in the store's local timezone.
* **mechanic/scheduler/monday**\
  Runs every Monday at midnight, in the store's local timezone. (Note: this would be at the end of Sunday evening). Each named weekday is supported.

{% hint style="info" %}
More specific times can be achieved by subscribing to an event topic with a delay (e.g. "mechanic/scheduler/daily+5.hours"). To learn more, see [Subscriptions](../../core/tasks/subscriptions.md).
{% endhint %}

### User

Not to be confused with events in the User domain, the mechanic/user event subject describes ways that the user expresses their intent – to Mechanic – to run the task.

* **mechanic/user/trigger**\
  ****When used, adds a "Run task" button to the task itself. This button generates a new event, to which only this task will respond.
* **mechanic/user/text**\
  ****When used, adds a "Run task" button to the task itself. This button prompts the user with a multi-line text box. When submitted, an event is generated, to which only this task will respond. The event contains the user's input in its data, making user's input available in `{{ event.data }}`.



{% hint style="info" %}
Shopify events are received from Shopify, directly, and contain event data provided by Shopify. For a reference on what each event contains, see [Shopify's Webhook documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/events/webhook).

Tasks subscribing to Shopify events receive [Liquid environment variables](../../core/tasks/code/environment-variables.md), containing data from the webhook.

### Subscriptions

{% hint style="warning" %}
Shopify only allows subscription events for apps that _provide_ subscription contracts to customers. And, Shopify does not permit _other_ apps to access subscription data for other apps. This means that platforms like Mechanic can't monitor for Shopify events related to subscription contracts or subscription billing events.

Ultimately, this means that Mechanic cannot currently offer subscription event topics to developers.

## User

The User event domain is for custom, user-generated events, having any subject and verb (e.g. "user/foo/bar"). As with all events, a User event topic must use the standard three-part topic form, but only the "user/" prefix is mandatory.

Mechanic allows developers several ways to generate custom User events:

* The [Event action](../../core/actions/event.md) can be used with any User event topic
* [Webhooks](../webhooks.md) may be configured to generate events using any User event topic

### Additional apps

Mechanic invites third-party app developers to develop Mechanic integrations, making it easy for developers to use our services together. If you're an app developer interested in this, email [team@usemechanic.com](mailto:team@usemechanic.com).

{% hint style="info" %}
Third-party services can often be connected to Mechanic using [webhooks](../webhooks.md).
