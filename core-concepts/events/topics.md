# Topics

To make events easy to identify, each event has a **topic**. A topic looks like "shopify/customers/create", and it has three parts:

* The **domain** describes the source of the event. Shopify events have "shopify" as their domain, and events generated by Mechanic itself use "mechanic".
* The **subject** describes the type of resource the event describes. Events that are about customers have "customers" as their subject, and events that are about orders have "orders".
* The **verb** describes what has just occurred. Events that are about creating resources generally have "create" as their verb, and events that are about deleting resources generally have "delete".

## User-defined topics

The User event domain is for custom, user-generated events, having any subject and verb \(e.g. "user/foo/bar"\). As with all events, a User event topic must use the standard three-part topic form, but only the "user/" prefix is mandatory.

Mechanic allows developers several ways to generate custom User events:

* The [Event action](../actions/action-types/event.md) can be used with any User event topic
* [Webhooks](../../platform/webhooks.md) may be configured to generate events using any User event topic
