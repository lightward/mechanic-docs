# Events

In Mechanic, an **event** represents anything that happens. This could be an order being paid, or a customer record being created, or a fulfillment being delivered.

An event always has a [**topic**](event-topic-reference/), and usually contains **data**. Events may trigger any number of [**tasks**](../tasks/), resulting in any number of [**actions**](../actions/).

Events are fed into Mechanic by the responsible party – for events that are about things in Shopify, for example, the events come to Mechanic from Shopify itself.
