# Can I add a time delay to my task?

Almost certainly! The feature you're looking for is called a [subscription offset](../core/tasks/subscriptions.md#offsets), and it allows you to specify a delay period in minutes, hours, or days.

You can modify your task's subscriptions by entering Advanced mode in the task editor.
