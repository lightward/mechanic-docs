# Can I control staff access for specific Mechanic tasks?

Not within the app. Access to the Mechanic app (as it shows up within the Shopify admin) is all or nothing, for staff members of a Shopify store.

Like a machine shop, Mechanic is modeled as a trusted technical environment. If you're in, it's assumed you can be responsible with the tools within reach. We hold this to be an important aspect of Mechanic's natural posture.

Having said that, we get it. :) There are workarounds!

## Workarounds

* [Mechanic webhooks](../platform/webhooks.md) can be used to Mechanic tasks from outside the app. We've seen teams build small staff dashboards with buttons that invoke an array of Mechanic tasks, sometimes with staff input.
* [Mechanic email](../platform/email/#receiving-email) supports inbound messages too! This allows tasks to be triggered by emails sent to your store's built-in Mechanic email address.
* If you've got a specific scenario that you feel should be possible but isn't workable with webhooks or email, [post it in our community Slack](../resources/slack.md).
