# How do I stop a large batch of runs?

If you reading this, you may be looking at a very large batch of task or action runs, all related to a single task, none of which you want to actually run. And, because there are so many queued up, your Mechanic account is prevented from processing incoming events.

To solve this problem, disable the task responsible for those task or action runs.

This won't immediately cancel all of those runs, _but_, those runs will be instantly cancelled as soon as Mechanic processes them, because Mechanic will not process a run for a disabled task. Take advantage of this, to clear up your queue much more quickly.
