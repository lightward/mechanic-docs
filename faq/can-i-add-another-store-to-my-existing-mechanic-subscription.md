# Can I add another store to my existing Mechanic subscription?

Every customer-facing Shopify store needs its own Mechanic subscription.

[Our Pay What Feels Good pricing policy](https://lightward.com/pricing) has a useful side-effect in cases like this: it means you can think about all of your Shopify stores together, when feeling out a total price for Mechanic that feels good to you.

To talk about adjusting new and existing Mechanic subscriptions for your stores, write in with all the details to team@usemechanic.com.
