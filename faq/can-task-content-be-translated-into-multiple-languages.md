# Can task content be translated into multiple languages?

The tasks in [Mechanic's library](../resources/task-library/) don't generally include provisions for content translations/localizations â€“ this can be a relevant concern for customer-facing messaging, like email.

To handle translations, some merchants install multiple copies of a task, and tune the options of each task to address specific locales, with locale-specific content.

In other cases, task code can be customized to allow for specifying multiple translations within a single task, switching between them as appropriate. (Typically, this means adding a [keyval option](https://learn.mechanic.dev/core/tasks/options#flags) allowing the user to specify and identify content as needed.)
