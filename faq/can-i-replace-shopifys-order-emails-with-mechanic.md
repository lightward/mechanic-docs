# Can I replace Shopify's order emails with Mechanic?

To our knowledge, Shopify Plus stores _are_ able to disable Shopify's own order confirmation emails. Apart from that, most customer-facing order notifications cannot be disabled, [but a few can](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/notifications/order-notifications#disable-a-notification)!

Mechanic cannot be used to disable any automatic Shopify emails. Only Shopify can control whether or not Shopify-powered emails are sent.
