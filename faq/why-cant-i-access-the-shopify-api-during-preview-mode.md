# Why can't I access the Shopify API during preview mode?

A task is always run in response to an event. However, for several purposes, Mechanic may also run your task with a preview event, _without_ performing any of the actions the task generates.

We refer to this as [**preview mode**](../core/tasks/previews/), and it's used for...

* Showing merchants what actions they can expect the task to perform
* Determining what permissions the task requires in order to run
* Performance-related analysis

Because all of these purposes require _very_ fast performance of the task, Mechanic disallows all API requests during preview mode. You can use the `event.preview` variable to make decisions about what should happen during preview mode, like creating [**stub data**](../core/tasks/previews/stub-data.md) that results in the appropriate actions being rendered during preview â€“ a good practice when accounting for [**preview actions**](../core/tasks/previews/#rendering-preview-actions).
