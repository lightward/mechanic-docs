# Can I manually set Shopify permissions for Mechanic?

Only implicitly. Mechanic will only ever request Shopify permissions based on what a task does during preview, so that's your chance to _fully_ demonstrate what your task intends to do.

Task previews are a really important part of how Mechanic works, so make sure you understand and are using them to the fullest.

**Start learning about previews here:** [**Core / Tasks / Previews**](../core/tasks/previews/)

Having trouble getting your permissions and previews to line up? Try asking in our [community Slack workspace](../resources/slack.md). Sharing your task code there is a good way to get suggestions about how to move forward. :)
