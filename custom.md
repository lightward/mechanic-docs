# ðŸ™‹ "I need something custom!"

Mechanic is a development platform â€“ in the hands of a developer, it can be used to accomplish almost anything in Shopify. While our [task library](resources/task-library/) covers many use cases, Mechanic's true strength is in letting developers solve merchant problems quickly, giving merchants easy configuration forms for managing the resulting tasks.

{% hint style="info" %}
Need something that you think others might need too? The Mechanic community accepts [task requests](resources/task-library/requesting.md), and the top-voted requests are regularly selected for implementation.
{% endhint %}

## If you need a developerâ€¦

Mechanic's automation tasks are written in Liquid, which is a template language used heavily in and around Shopify. This means that developers of all levels, with even a little Shopify development experience, can get started with Mechanic.

**To find a developer for hire, start by posting in the #jobs channel of Mechanic's Slack workspace.** [**Use this link to join**](https://join.slack.com/t/usemechanic/shared\_invite/zt-cq84nrs7-ggYbYTbf\~CrCjTg8nmHP2A)**.** This is a super common path, and the Mechanic community is here to help. :)

**You can also contact Mechanic Partners directly at** [**partners.mechanic.dev**](https://partners.mechanic.dev)**.** This is a growing list of established developers, both independent and agency, who can help you with your implementation.

Lastly: if you already have a developer on your team, or have an existing connection to a developer, send them this article and see if they can help you!

## If you are a developerâ€¦

If you're familiar with Liquid, and Shopify's Admin APIs, start by picking something from our [task library](resources/task-library/) that's close to what you're looking for, then modify it as needed.

Make sure to take advantage of the documentation found here, beginning with the Core Concepts section. Mechanic is a powerful system, and grounding yourself in the fundamentals is a good way to begin.

Finally, join Mechanic's Slack workspace to exchange support with the community â€“ [use this link to join](https://join.slack.com/t/usemechanic/shared\_invite/zt-cq84nrs7-ggYbYTbf\~CrCjTg8nmHP2A). The #general channel is a great place to start, and it's filled with people who are using Mechanic to solve problems every day. :)
