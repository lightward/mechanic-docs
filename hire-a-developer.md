# ðŸ¤“ Hire a Mechanic developer

Mechanic's automation tasks are written in Liquid, which is a template language used heavily in and around Shopify. This means that developers of all levels, with even a little Shopify development experience, can get started with Mechanic.

**To find a developer for hire, start by posting in the #jobs channel of Mechanic's Slack workspace.** [**Use this link to join**](https://join.slack.com/t/usemechanic/shared\_invite/zt-cq84nrs7-ggYbYTbf\~CrCjTg8nmHP2A)**.** **Or, view our partner directory at** [**partners.mechanic.dev**](https://partners.mechanic.dev/)**.**

These are both a super common path, and the Mechanic community is here to help. :)
