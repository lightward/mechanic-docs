# ðŸ¤“ Hire a Mechanic developer

Mechanic's automation tasks are written in Liquid, which is a template language used heavily in and around Shopify. This means that developers of all levels, with even a little Shopify development experience, can get started with Mechanic.

**To find a developer for hire, you can contact Mechanic Partners directly at** [**partners.mechanic.dev**](https://partners.mechanic.dev/)**.** This is a growing list of established developers, both independent and agency, who can help you with your implementation.

This is a super common path, and the Mechanic community is here to help. :)

If you already have a developer on your team, or have an existing connection to a developer, send them [this article](custom.md) and see if they can help you!
