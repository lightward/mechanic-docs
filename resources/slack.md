# ðŸš€ Slack community

Mechanic was made for working together. Our Slack workspace is where hundreds of folx compare implementation notes, collaborate on projects, and talk about the evolution of Mechanic itself â€“ and it's the best place to ask your questions. You are always invited. :)

Got some code to share in Slack? Use [**code snippets**](https://slack.com/slack-tips/share-code-snippets) to share code with line numbers, and syntax highlighting, in a way that doesn't take up lots of vertical space in the channel. **Don't share lots of code without a snippet!**
