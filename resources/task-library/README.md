# 🧑💻 Task library

Mechanic's **task library** is a compendium of e-commerce automation tasks and documentation, written by the Mechanic community and the Mechanic core team. [Hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/lightward/mechanic-tasks), everything is open-sourced under the highly permissive [MIT license](https://github.com/lightward/mechanic-tasks/blob/master/LICENSE), making all library tasks appropriate for re-use and modification.

When building a new task, it's often easier to modify an existing task than to create a task from scratch. Searching GitHub is a good place to start, when looking for inspiration.

**To browse the task library, visit** [**tasks.mechanic.dev**](https://tasks.mechanic.dev)**.**

**The Mechanic community can request new tasks – see **[**Requesting**](requesting.md)**.**

**The task library is open for contributions, by way of pull requests – see** [**Contributing**](contributing.md)**.**
