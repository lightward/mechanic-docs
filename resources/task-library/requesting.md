# Requesting

The Mechanic community maintains a board of task requests, where anyone can submit their idea for an addition to the Mechanic task library.

### How does this work?

Twice a month \(on the 15th and last day of the month\), Mechanic staff will commission the top-voted task  for implementation \(filtering by the criteria below\).

### What kind of task requests are accepted?

We accept task requests in two categories:

* Tasks that are broadly useful off-the-shelf for non-technical users
* Tasks that are useful foundations for developers, for further modification or inspiration

### Who implements these task requests?

The Mechanic staff commission these from developers in the Mechanic community. If you're a developer interested in receiving this kind of work, get in touch at [team@usemechanic.com](mailto:team@usemechanic.com).

### Where can I file a task request?
