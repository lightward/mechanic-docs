# Finding a resource ID

To find an ID for a resource in a Shopify store, start by opening the Shopify admin area. Then, navigate to the specific resource whose ID is needed. Lastly, look at the browser's address bar: the ID is the number at the very end.

This applies for most resources in Shopify, whether it's an order, location, product, variant, etc. For example, when looking at an order, the URL will look something like this:

```
https://admin.shopify.com/store/example/orders/1234567890
```

And in this example, the ID is still the number at the very end.
