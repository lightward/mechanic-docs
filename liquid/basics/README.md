# Basics

Mechanic uses [**Liquid**](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), a template language created by Shopify. If you have worked with the code behind Shopify themes, you've worked with Liquid.

If you are new to Liquid or need a refresher, the next few sections will cover the basics of the language.

{% hint style="info" %}
Mechanic uses its own variant of Liquid, which we call [Mechanic-flavored Liquid](../mechanic/). It has all the features of Liquid itself, and adds a few that specifically facilitate Mechanic development.

## Shopify Liquid cheat sheet

Shopify offers an excellent [Liquid cheat sheet](https://www.shopify.com/partners/shopify-cheat-sheet), a quick reference for the fundamentals. Note, however, that Liquid objects documented here do not mirror the objects offered in Mechanic-flavored Liquid. When using this cheat sheet for Mechanic work, ignore the "Objects" section entirely. :\)
